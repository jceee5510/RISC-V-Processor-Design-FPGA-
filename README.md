# RISC-V-Processor-Design-FPGA
# This project consists of an impementation of RISC-V on a DE-10 Lite FPGA. It is a processor designed with the RV32I Base Integer instruction set. 
# System Verilog was used to create this project and ModelSim was used for testing purposes.
# A detailed explanation and report can be found in Detailed_Report.pdf.
